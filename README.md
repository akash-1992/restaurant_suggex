# restaurant_suggex
An application program that fetches the details of Zomato suggested restaurants through keyword searches 
or GPS location coordinates within 5 km of the mentioned location. Zomato's search API is embedded with 
the python based application using the HTTP method of the RESTful API service. This information is 
updated and displayed on the webpage in real time using JQuery. In the final version, a database of 
Indian cities is also augmented at the backend to show keyword suggestions in the search bar using the
Twitter API. Further, Bootstrap design elements are used to represent the user interface in the final
app.
